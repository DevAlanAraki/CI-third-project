# Hangman Game

This is a Hangman game project created for the Code Institute course. The game allows the player seven attempts to try to guess a random word.

## Features

* Random word selection: The game selects a word at random from a pre-defined list of words.

* Progress display: The player can see their progress through the game, with underscores representing unguessed letters and correctly guessed letters revealed.

* Guessing mechanism: The player can input their guesses and receive feedback on whether the guess is correct or incorrect.

* Incorrect guesses tracking: The game keeps track of the incorrect guesses made by the player and displays them.

* Win/Loss condition: The game determines whether the player has won or lost based on the number of incorrect guesses made.

## Technologie Used

* The game logic is implemented using Python entirely to handle word selection, player input, and game outcomes.

* Usage

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. The game will start automatically.
3. Guess letters by typing on the keyboard and pressing "ENTER" key.
4. Continue guessing until you have correctly guessed the word or run out of attempts.
5. After the game ends, you can start a new game by typing "Y" to start again or "N" to exit the game.

## Testing

* I tested playing this game multiple times in different browsers such as Firefox, Edge and Chrome.
* The game output the correct result for the user.
* I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screens sizes using the devtoop device toolbar.

## Validator Testing

* PYTHON
  * No errors were returned when passing through the official PEP8 Python Validator.

## Unfixed bugs

No unfixed bugs

## Deployment

* The game was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.
    * Steps for deployment:
        * Fork or clone the template repository
        * Create a new Heroku app
        * Set the buildbacks to Python and NodeJS in that order
        * Link the Heroku app to the respective GitHub repository
        * Click to Deploy
